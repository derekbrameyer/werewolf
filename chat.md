Any way to get a sidebar @rasa? like... a view into your project / let us open
things? ... jay is typing.

 > nvm, @rasa fixed in prettier config, woo!

                                                                     WAY UP HERE <--.
rasa: prettier should ignore this now                                               |
jay: @rasa the ``` ``` below? or just this file?                        AND HERE <--|
rasa: this file                                                                     |
jay: going by "j" from now on.                                              HERE <--|
rasa: let's keep this file linear,                                                  |
j: @rasa if we keep it linear... that's like a single room vs. being able to type /
rasa: We can have multiple files, but this is chat.md (lol)
j: @rasa, okay you make a fair point.  can we have another file for misc
stuff then? thx.
     > j: nah, changed my mind. chat.md is good... for now :p

rasa: ???
 > j: making it all linear
 > rasa: cool

jeff: what test runner is this? Jasmine?
 > rasa: Jest

rasa: Ill keep more files open so y'all can poke around
rasa: BRB, time to eat some cookies
 > j: 👋

rasa: back
      can you see the failing test or the type errors?
      You may need the typescript and jest plugins

rasa: heck... we should do this in elm
      ok, time to port this (:joy:)
